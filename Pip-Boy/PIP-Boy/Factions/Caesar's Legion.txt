Also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward 'Caesar' Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse.
