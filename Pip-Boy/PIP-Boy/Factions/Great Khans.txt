The Khans were a raider tribe descended from one of the three raider clans that originated from Vault 15. They have a long and turbulent history and have been nearly wiped out on three occasions. After the original Khans faced near-extinction following the Vault Dweller's actions, they were succeeded by the New Khans and then the Great Khans.
