The Boomers are a tribe formed out of a group of vault dwellers who originally inhabited Vault 34. The overstocked, unprotected armory led to the emergence of a particularly gun-centric culture among the dwellers. The Boomers were a group particularly obsessed with weapons and the right to keep and bear them freely. When the population of the Vault ballooned in the early 23rd century, the Vault's overseer attempted to salvage the situation by introducing population control measures and sealing the armory. The efforts backfired, as rioting began, quickly turning into full-out rebellion. The future Boomers attacked the armory, taking most of the heavy weapons and equipment, then fought their way out of the vault. The reactor was damaged in the attack, dooming the vault.
