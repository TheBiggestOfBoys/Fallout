# This repository has coding projects based on the "Fallout" video games

## It has a recreation of the [PIP-Boy](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pip-Boy)

### It contains sound effects from the games. I might include some songs from the games, but that might make the download size to large

## It also has a recreation of the [Terminal Hacking Minigame](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hacking)

### Unlike other versions, it uses real *.F files for the memory dumps, and has *txt files as the data entries
